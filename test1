My working hypothesis is that the `userId` used to delete the `UserTokens` is not always the same as the one used to create them and so the cleanup is not working correctly. I've yet to recreate the bug, though, so this is just my best guess.\r\n\r\n<!-- Feel free to add any additional description of changes below this line -->\r\n",
